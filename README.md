# blockchain-emr
An application of Block Chain to electronic medical records.

---

## Hypothesis:
# Applying the concepts behind *blockchain*, we can create a computer application stores de-identified medical data which can be available to any researchers to work with.

## Comments:
Block Chain can support the CliniQuick model where past data cannot be modified, while the information in the last visit can.  Since modifying previous blocks is so expensive, editing of old data would be prohibitive.  Modifying the last record requires less expense.

    We are beginning an exploration on how to apply blockchain concepts to electronic medical records.  At the end of this process we should be able to tell if it is a viable approach.  If viable, we should have a very small proof of concept.  If not viable, we should be able to write a paper with our findings.

- Our current tasks: - <br/>
· Learn as much as possible about <i>blockchain</i>.<br/>
· Come up with ideas on how to build the system.<br/>
· Identify major roadblocks and issues.<br>
